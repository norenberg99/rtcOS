    Description: 
        This file contains the interface to the RtcOS system.
        Run To Completion OS allows each "task" to run until completed.
        RtcOS allows the creation of tasks which can send
        and receive events from other tasks or interrupt service 
        routines.  A task runs till completion, which means it
        handles the event sent to it.  Tasks should only handled
        one event and then return to the system.  If that task
        is still the highest priority, then it will be called
        again with the other outstanding events.  Again, the task
        should handle one event and then return.  This allows
        a higher priority task to run if it has events.  A task
        can prioritize its own events depending on the order
        they are processed in their event handler routine.

        The event system is very simple in that you can send one
        event at a time.  Events can be sent immediately to the receiving 
        task or they can be delayed by some amount of ticks.  A tick
        duration varies from system to system.  It depends on
        how often the osUpdateTick() is called.  If it is called
        every millisecond then a tick is one millisecond.  If it is 
        called every 10 milliseconds then a tick is 10 milliseconds.

        When an event has a delay associated with it, then the
        caller can also specify if they want the event to be
        sent continually or just once.  This is determined by
        reloadDelay paramter in osSendEvent().  This parameter
        is not valid for events sent immediately.

        To stop an event from being sent you can clear the event, which
        will clear the immediate or future event.  So if you have
        a continually sending event, you can stop it with the
        osClearEvent function.

        When no events are in the system then in theory the processor
        could stop or go to sleep until an interrupt arrives.  If you
        want the system to sleep then you must register a sleep routine
        with the system that will be called if there are no events
        in the system.
